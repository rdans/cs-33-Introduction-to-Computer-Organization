1. Download the given openmp lab from ccle and copy and paste it into the linux
server 07. To do that, I use WinSCP, downloaded and unzipped the file, and
then copy and paste all the containing folder to the server.

For step 2 and 3, I tried it on June 5th Monday 3:48 PM

2. We compile normally using command
   $ make seq
   $ ./seq
and the Output is
FUNC TIME : 0.663664
TOTAL TIME : 3.619525

3. Now, we want to compile with gprof enabled because gprof will give
approximate statistics on how often each function is called.
  $ make seq GPROF=1
  $ ./seq
FUNC TIME : 0.786578
TOTAL TIME : 3.640110

      $ gprof seq | less

Give an output :

Then I create a copy of func.c file with a name func1.c in order to determine
how much speed that I get. I need to create a copy of it because everytime
you test the runtime, it will show you a different func and total time based
on several factors, such as how many people that uses the server at that time.
Thus, to get more precise measurement of how much speed that we acquire, it's
best to create the copy of func.c file as a comparison.
