A. In the if statement, maxbytes which has signed int type will be minused by
  sizeof operator which return unsigned int type, which result in an unsigned
  int type in the whole operation. This whole operation then will always return
  a >=0 value, which will always true.

B. We can change the conditional statement by
  if (maxbytes - ((int) sizeof(val)) >= 0)
