Before do anything in lnxsrv07, I want to make sure to update my path to avoid any error using command
$ PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
 
First, we want to access the executable that in ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2 using gdb.
$ gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2 

Then, we set up a breakpoint at Ftimes to get the trace of the key part of the above test
case
(gdb) break Ftimes

Now, we need to run the program and stop at the first breakpoint at Ftimes
(gdb) r -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'

Now, I want to set the debugger to print each instruction as it's executed.
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on


Then, we step into each function to determine the instruction that executed
(gdb) si

 
I notice, there is an arrow pointing to the instruction, and that arrow actually telling that the pointed
particular machine instruction has not beet executed yet.  

To keep track of some changing address, we find it using info register
(gdb) info register

We basically play around with command si and info register, until machine instruction showing retq, which
means that Ftimes function has been done. Then copy the machine instruction that executed
in trace.tr
